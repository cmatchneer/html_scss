# html_scss
Welcome to my first scss project and also my first time using gulp as well. I created this site using html and scss. This time I did all the styling. I based this on another site I was shown. My main objectives were to recreate the site and make it responsive. I used google to find a nav bar, footer and testimonial and then made changes to their background color and in the case of the footer and nav bar add the logo which is the circle and the oval. The rest I created from scratch for this project. I also used linkedin scss basic training to learn the basics and then googled when I got stuck in places. Overall I am happy with the outcome. Creating the features part was the hardest part of the project. Getting them to fit on screen wrap and look good was real pain and I am happy with how they came out. I hope you enjoy this project
